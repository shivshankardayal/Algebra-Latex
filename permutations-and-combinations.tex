\chapter{Permutations and Combinations}
In this chapter we will study basic principles of counting, permutations and combinations. This study will enable you to further
study the branch of mathematics called combinatorics. You would have certainly encountered a combinatorical problem in your
life. It would be really surprising if you have not. Have you ever solved a Sudoku puzzle or Rubik's cube? Have you ever counted
the number of poker hands that are full houses in order to determine the odds against a full house? Have you ever attempted to
trace through a network without removing your pencil from paper and wihtout tracing any part of network more than once? These are
all combinatorical problems. As you can see that combinatorics has evolved from mathematical games.

With the invention of modern computers, we are enabled to solve more and more problems of combinatorics which were earlier not
feasible due to calculations involved. The computer programs are often based on combinatorical algorithms which determine the speed
and efficiency of the solution. Analysis of these programs and algorithms require sound knowledge of combinatorical mathematics and
thinking. In computer science we write test cases for our programs, and those test cases can be enumerated by applying permutations
and combinations on input data and states produced in the program. Combinatorics is a powerful tool for making sure that the tester
does not miss any test case, which in mission-critical programs is of paramount importance.

The best way to learn combinatorics is to solve a lot of problems. This is in general true for all branches of mathematics but even
more so for combinatorics because a problem which appears simple may be quite difficult to solve or require critical thinking. By
solving problems of different kinds, and by repeating them the concepts will be enforced and discipline will develop.

We start with four basic counting principles and then we will progress into permutations and combinatins. To study the topic of
permutations and combinations it is required to have basic knowledge in set theory which the reader is expected to know.

\section{Four Basic Counting Principles}
Let $S$ be a set. A \textit{partition} of $S$ is a collection of $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ of subsets of $S$ such that each element
in $S$ is in exactly one of these subsets:
$$S = S_1\cup S_2\cup\ldots\cup S_m$$
$$S_i\cap S_j = \phi(i\neq j)$$
Thus, the sets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ are pairwise disjoint sets, and their union is $S$. The subsets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ are
called the \textit{parts} of the partition. Note that by this definition a part of the partition may be empty, but usually there is
no advantage in considering partitions with one or more empty sets. The number of objects of a set $S$ is denoted by $|S|$, and is
called the \textit{size} of $S$.

\subsection{Addition Principle}
Suppose that a $S$ is partitioned into pairwise disjoint partys $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$. The number of objects in $S$ can be
determined by finding the number of objects in each of the parts, and adding the numbers so obtained:
$$|S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \ldots |S_m|$$.
If the sets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ are allowed to overlap, then a more profound principle, the inclusion-exclusion principle can
be used to count the number of objects in $S$.

We need to be careful when partitioning $S$ into too many parts. For example, if we partition $S$ into parts in such a way that
each part contains only one element then addition princinple is becomes counting the number of parts, which is basically same as
listing all objects of $S$. Thus the art of applying addition princinple is to partition the set $S$ into not too many parts.

\noindent\textbf{Example:} In a university there are four mathematics courses, two economics courses, and three lietrature
courses. A student is allowed to enroll into one course at most. Thus, we see that a student can take a course in $4 + 2 + 3 = 9$
ways.

Next principle is multiplication principle which will be stated for two sets, but it can be generalized to any finite number of
sets.

\subsection{Multiplication Principle}
Let $S$ be a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$, where the first object comes from a set of size $p$, and for each choice of object $a$
there are $q$ choices for object $b$. Then the size of $S$ is $p\times q$:
$$|S| = p\times q$$
As in basic arithmetic multiplication is repeated addition, similarly multiplication principle is actuallly a consequence of the
addition principle i.e. repeated addition. Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_p$ be $p$ different choices for the object $a$. We partition
$S$ into parts $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_p$ where $S_i$ is the set of ordered pairs in $S$ with first object $a_i(i = 1, 2, \ldots,
p)$. The size of each $S_i$ is $q$; hence, by the addition principle,
$$|S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \ldots + |S_p|$$
$$= q + q + \ldots + q(p q'\text{s})$$
$$= p\times q$$
The multiplication principle can be stated in another way as: If a first task has $p$ outcomes, and no matter what the outcome of of
the first task, a second task has $q$ outcomes i.e. outcomes for two tasks are mutually exclusive, then the two tasks can be
performed in $p\times q$ outcomes.

\noindent\textbf{Example:} Pencil comes in two different lengths, four different hardness, and three different thickness. How many
different types of pencils are there?

The pencil has three different properties, which are exclusive of each other, and thus, we can apply multiplication
principle. Hence, number of different types of pencils is $2\times4\times3 = 24$.

\noindent\textbf{Example:} The number of ways a man, woman, boy, and girl can be selected from three men, three women, five boys and
four girls is $3\times3\times5\times4 = 180$.

\noindent\textbf{Example:} Determine the number of positive integers that are factors of the number
$$2^3\times3^4\times5^5\times7^7$$
The numbers $2, 3, 5,$ and $7$ are prime numbers. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, each factor is of the form
$$2^i\times3^j\times5^k\times7^l$$
where $0\leq i\leq2, 0\leq j\leq3, 0\leq k\leq5,$ and $0\leq l\leq7$. There are three choices for $i$, four for $j$, six for $k$, and
eight for $l$. By multiplication principle, the number of factors is $3\times4\times6\times8 = 576$.

In the multiplication principle the $q$ choices for object $b$ may vary with the choices of $a$. The only requirement is that there
be the same number $q$ of choices, not necessarily the same choices.

\noindent\textbf{Example:} How many two-digit numbers have distinct, and nonzero digits?

A two-digit number $ab$ can be regarded as an ordered pair $(a, b)$, where $a$ is the tens digit, and $b$ is the units digit. Both
are not allowed to be $0$, and they must be different. Thus, we see that there are $9$ ways to choose $a$, which are $1, 2, \ldots,
9$. Once $a$ is chosen we cannot use the same digit for $b$, which means we are left with $8$ choices for $b$. Here we see that
choice of $a$ makes a difference on what choices $b$ has. However, for multiplication principle to be applicable what matters is
that the number of choices remain constant which is $8$ in this case. Applying multiplication principle, we arrive at the answer of
the question as $9\times8 = 72$.

There is another way to arrive at the same result. Total number of two-digit number is $90, 10,11, 12, \ldots, 99$. Of these $90$
numbers $9$ have a zero in them$(10, 20, 30, \ldots, 90)$, and $9$ have repeated digits$(11, 22, \ldots, 99)$. Thus, total number of
required numbers equals $90 - 9 - 9 = 72$.

We can derive two important ideas from the previous example. First is that it is possible to solve a counting problem in many
ways. The second idea is that to find the number of objects in a set $A$ (in this csae the set of two-digit numbers with nonzero,
and distinct digits) it may be easier to find the number of objects in a larger set $U$ containing $S$ (the set of all
two-digit numbers), and then subtract the number of objects of $U$ that do not belong to $A$ (the two-digit numbers containing $0$
or repeated digit). This leads us to subtraction principle.

\subsection{Subtraction Principle:}
Let $A$ be a set, and let $U$ be a larger set containing $A$. Let
$$\overline{A} = U\textbackslash A = \{x\in U: x\notin A\}$$
be the complement of $A$ in $U$. Then the numebr $|A|$ of object in $A$ is given by the rule
$$|A| = |U| - |\overline{A}|$$

The set $U$ is usually some natural set containing all the objects under discussion (it is called \textit{universal set}). Using
the subtraction principle should be used only if it is easier to count the number of object in $U$ nd $\overline{A}$ tha to count the
number of objects in $A$.

\noindent\textbf{Example:} Most websites on internet have a lower limit of $8$ characters as password length. Suppose if these
passwordss are to made up of the digits $0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9$, and the lowercase letters $a, b, c, \ldots, z$ then how many passwords
will have a repeated symbol?

There are a total of $10$ digits, and $26$ letters i.e. 36 symbols. So by two applications of multiplication principle, we get
$$|U| = 36^8 = 2,821,109,907,456$$
and
$$|\overline{A}| = 36.35.34.33.32.31.30.29 = 1,220,096,908,800$$
Therefore,
$$|A| = |U| - |\overline{A}| = 1,601,012,998,656$$.

Now we will formulate the last principle of counting principles.

\subsection{Division Principle}
Let $S$ be a finite set that is partitioned into $k$ parts in such a way that each part contains the same number of objects. Then
the number of parts in the partition is given by the rule
$$k = \frac{|S|}{\text{number of objects in a part}}$$

\noindent\textbf{Example;} There are $240$ rats in a collection of cages. If each cage contains $2$ rats, the number of cages
equals $$\frac{240}{2} = 120$$.

Interesting problems of division principle will be found in the problems section.

Most counting problems can be classified as one of the following types:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Count the number of ordered arrangements or ordered selection of objects
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item without repeating any object,
  \item with repetion(perhaps limited) of objects permitted.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Count the number of unordered arrangements or unordered selection of objects
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item without repeating any object,
  \item with repetion(perhaps limited) of objects permitted.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

We can represent repetition, and nonrepetition of objects as selection from a set, and a multiset. The latter might prove to be more
useful in some cases. A \textit{multiset} is like a set except that its members need not be distinct.\footnote{Thus, a cardinal
rule of sets is broken by multisets because a set is not supposed to have duplicates or repeated elements. The set $\{a, a, b\}$ is
same as the set $\{a, b\}$ but not so for multisets} For example, a multiset $M$ with three $a$'s, two $b$'s i.e. $5$ elements of
$2$ different types. We usually indicate a multiset by specifying the number of times different types of elements occur in
it. Thus, $M$ is denoted by $\{3.a,2.b\}$.\footnote{In standard set-theory's notation, we could denote the multiset $M$ using
ordered pairs as $\{(a, 3), (b, 2)\}$}. The numbers $3$, and $2$ are the \textit{repetition members} of the multiset $M$. Thus we
can extrapolate that a set is a multiset with all repetition numbers equal to $1$. Often there is no limit on number of repetitions
i.e. infinite repetitions are allowed.\footnote{In no circumstance, we need to consider different sizes of $\infty$.}

\section{Factorial of $n$}
Factorial of $n$ is denoted by $n!$. In the old style it is written as $\oldfact{n}$. $n!$ is given by the first $n$ natural
numbers, i.e. $$n! = 1.2.3.4\ldots(n - 1).n$$ Also, $0! = 1$, which we will prove later.

Permutation means arrangement of objects along with selection. In the permutation of object order matter. If order of object
changes then their permutation also changes. Combination of objects means selection of objects in such a way that order does not
matter.

\section{Permutation of Sets}
Let $r\in \mathbb{P}$. By an $r$-\textit{permutation} of a set $S$ of $n$ elements has a meaning of an ordered(by definition of
permutation) arrangement of $r$ of the $n$ elements$(r\leq n)$. If $S = \{a, b, c\},$ then the three $1$-permutations of $S$ are
$$a~~~b~~~c,$$
the six $2$-permutations of $S$ are
$$ab~~~ac~~~ba~~~bc~~~ca~~~cb,$$
and the six $3$-permutations of $S$ are
$$abc~~~acb~~~bac~~~bca~~~cab~~~cba.$$

There are no $4$-permutations of $S$ because that will violate the assumption that $r\leq n$.

The $r$-permutations of an $n$-element set is denoted by $P(n, r)$ or ${}_nP_r$ or ${}^nP_r$. If $r > n$ then ${}^nP_r =
0$. Clearly, ${}^nP_1 = n$ for each $n\in \mathbb{P}$.

For $n$ and $r$ positive integers with $r\leq n,$ $${}^nP_r = n\times(n - 1)\times\ldots\times(n - r + 1).$$

Permutation of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time is equivalent ot filling $r$ different vacant spots from $n$ different objects. We
can fill first spot by $n$ ways, second spot can be filled by remaining objects i.e. $n - 1$ ways, and proceeding this way we find
that $r$th spot can be filled in $n - r + 1$ ways. Thus total number of ways is $$n\times(n - 1)\times\ldots(n - r + 1)$$.

We can rewrite the above as $$\frac{n\times(n - 1)\ldots(n - r + 1)\times(n - r)\times\ldots2\times 1}{(n - r)\times(n - r -
  1)\times\ldots2\times1}$$
$${}^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$

Alternatively, first place can be filled in $n$ ways. Rest of $r - 1$ spots from $n - 1$ objects can be filled in ${}^{n - 1}P_{r -
1}$ ways. Thus, ${}^nP_r = n.{}^{n - 1}P_{r - 1}$. Similarly, ${}^{n - 1}P_{r - 1} = (n - 1).{}^{n - 2}P_{r - 2}$. Proceeding this
way we find that ${}^{n - r + 1}P_1 = n - r + 1$. Multiplying and cancelling common factors, we get ${}^nP_r = n\times(n -
1)\times\ldots\times(n - r + 1).$

The number of permutations of $n$ elements is ${}^nP_n = \frac{n!}{0!} = n!$. If we follow first result then it is evident that $0!
= 1.$

\subsection{Meaning of $\frac{1}{(-k)!}, k\in\mathbb{P}$}
We have ${}^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$. Putting $r = n + k$, we have ${}^nP_{n + k} = \frac{n!}{(-k)!}$. But the number of ways of
arranging $n + 1$ objects out of $n$ different objects $= 0 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{(-k)!} = 0.$

\noindent\textbf{Note:} Although $(-k)!$ has no meaning by the definition of factorial but if we consider the above result then the
formula for permutation becomes valid even for $r > n.$

\subsection{Circular Permutation}
Let us consider arranging objects along a circle. Let us consider that four persons $A, B, C,$ and $D$ are sitting around a table. We
can have following arrangements:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) circle (1cm);
    \draw (3cm,0) circle (1cm);
    \draw (6cm,0) circle (1cm);
    \draw (9,0) circle (1cm);
    \draw (1cm, 0) node[anchor=east] {$A$};
    \draw (0, 1cm) node[anchor=north] {$B$};
    \draw (-1cm, 0) node[anchor=west] {$C$};
    \draw (0, -1cm) node[anchor=south] {$D$};
    \draw (4cm, 0) node[anchor=east] {$D$};
    \draw (3cm, 1cm) node[anchor=north] {$A$};
    \draw (2cm, 0) node[anchor=west] {$B$};
    \draw (3cm, -1cm) node[anchor=south] {$C$};
    \draw (7cm, 0) node[anchor=east] {$C$};
    \draw (6cm, 1cm) node[anchor=north] {$D$};
    \draw (5cm, 0) node[anchor=west] {$A$};
    \draw (6cm, -1cm) node[anchor=south] {$B$};
    \draw (10cm, 0) node[anchor=east] {$B$};
    \draw (9cm, 1cm) node[anchor=north] {$C$};
    \draw (8cm, 0) node[anchor=west] {$D$};
    \draw (9cm, -1cm) node[anchor=south] {$A$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

As shown four persons are sitting around a round table, and four anticlockwise rotations have lead to four arrangements. But if
$A,B,C,D$ are sitting in a row, and then are shiftedd such that last occupies the place of first, then the four arrangements will be
different. Thus, if there are $n$ objects then for each circular arrangement there are nn linear arrangements. But for $n$ different
objects total number of linear arrengements are $n!$ so the total number of circular arrangements are $$\frac{n!}{n} = (n - 1)!$$.

Thus, we can say that number of circular $r$-permutations of a set of $n$ elements is given by $$\frac{{}^nP_r}{r} = \frac{n!}{r.(n
  - r)!}$$

\subsection{Clockwise and Anti-Clockwise Arrangements}
When clockwise and anticlockwise arranegemnts are same then total number of permutations will become half of what we computed in
previous case i.e. $$\frac{{}^nP_r}{2r} = \frac{n!}{2r.(n - r)!}$$

\section{Combination of Sets}
Consider a set $S$ having $n$ elements. A \textit{combination} of a set $S$ has a meaning of an unordered selection of the elements
of $S$. The result of each selection is a \textit{subset} $A$ of the elements of $S: A\subset S$. Thus, the terms
\textit{combination} and \textit{subset} are interchangeable.

Now let $r$ be a nonnegative integer. By an $r$-\textit{combination} of a set $S$ of $n$ elements, we understand an unordered
selection of $r$ of the $n$ objects of $S$. The result will be an $r$-subset of $S$.

If $S = \{a, b, c, d\},$ then $$\{a, b, c\}, \{a, b, c\}, \{a, c, d\}, \{b, c, d\}$$ are the four $3$-subsets of $S$. We denote
the number of $r$-subsets or $r$-combinations of an $n$-element set by ${n\choose r}$ or ${}_nC_r$ or ${}^nC_r$. Obviously,
$${n\choose r} = 0~~~~~~\text{if~}r > n.$$
Also,
$${0\choose r} = 0~~~~~~\text{if~}r > 0.$$

The following facts are easy to figure out for each nonnegative integer $n$ $${0\choose 0} = {n\choose 0} = {n\choose n} = 1, {n\choose 1} = n,$$

For $0\leq r\leq n,$ $${}^nP_r = r!{}^nC_r.$$
Hence,
$${}^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$$

Let $S$ be an $n$-element set. Each $r$-permutation of $S$ arises from following tasks
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose $r$ elements from $S$.
\item Arrange the chose $r$ elements in some order.
\end{enumerate}

The number of ways to carry out first task, by definition, is ${}^nC_r$. The number of ways to carry out second task is ${}^nP_r =
r!$. By the multiplication principle, we have ${}^nP_r = r!{}^nC_r$. Now applying the formula for permutations, we have
$${}^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}.$$

\section{Permutation of Multisets}
Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ different types, where each object can be repeated infinitely. Then the number of
$r$-permutations of $S$ is $k^r$.

To prove this, we can choose the first item to be an object of any one of the $k$ types. Since the number of repetitions are
infinite the second item can be also chose in $k$ ways. In fact, any item can be chosen in $k$ ways due to infinite
repetition. Following, multiplication principle, total number of such permutations is $k^r$.

Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ different types with finite repetition numbers $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ respectively. Let
the size of $S$ be $n = n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_k.$ Then the number of permutations of $S$ equals $$\frac{n!}{n_!!n_2!\ldots
  n_k!}.$$

We can calculate this by thinking in terms of $n$ places, and we want to put exactly one of the objects of $S$ in each of the
places. We have $n_1$ objects of one type in $S$, so we must choose a subset of $n_1$ places from the set of $n$ places. We can do
this in ${}^nC_{n_1}$ ways. After this we have $n - n_1$ places left, and we have $n_2$ objects of second type. So following
similarly we can do this in ${}^{n - n_1}C_{n_2}$ ways. Following this way invoking multiplication principle, the number of
permutations of $S$ equals
$${}^nC_{n_1}.{}^{n - n_1}C_{n_2}.{}^{n - n_1 - n_2}C_{n_3}\ldots{}^{n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_{k - 1}}C_{n_k}$$
which gives
$$\frac{n!}{n_1!(n - n_1)!}.\frac{(n - n_1)!}{n_2!(n - n_1 - n_2)!}.\frac{(n - n_1 - n_2)!}{n_3!(n - n_1 - n_2 -n_3)!}\ldots
\frac{(n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_{k - 1})!}{n_k!(n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_k)!}$$
which after cancellation, reduces to
$$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}$$

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ be positive integers with $n = n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_k$. The number
of ways to partition a set of $n$ objects into $k$ labeled boxes in which Box 1 contains $n_1$ objects, Box 2 contains $n_2$
objects, $\ldots$, Box $k$ contains $n_k$ objects equals
$$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}.$$

If the boxes are not labeled, and $n_1 = n_2 = \ldots = n_k$, then the number of partitions equals $$\frac{n!}{k!n_1!n_2!\ldots
  n_k!}.$$

We can calculate this by direct application of the multiplication principle. So we first choose $n_1$ objects for the first box,
then $n_2$ of the remaining $n - n_1$ objects for the second box and so on. By the multiplication principle, the number of ways is
$${}^nC_{n_1}.{}^{n - n_1}C_{n_2}.{}^{n - n_1 - n_2}C_{n_3}\ldots{}^{n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_{k - 1}}C_{n_k}$$
which is same as the last result, i.e.
$$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}$$

If boxes are not labeled and $n_1 = n_2 = \ldots = n_k,$ then the result has to be divided by $k!$ because for each way of
distributing the objects into the $k$ unalbeled boxes there are $k!$ ways in which we can attach the labels to the boxes. Thus,
using the division principle, we arrive at the result as
$$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}.$$

\section{Combination of Multisets}
If $S$ is a multiset, then an $r$-combination of $S$ is an unorndered selection of $r$ of the objects of $S$. Thus, an
$r$-combination of $S$ is itslef a multiset, a \textit{submultiset} of $S$ of size $r$, or, for short, an $r$-submultiset. If $S$
has $n$ objects, then there is only one $n$-combination of $S$, namely, $S$ itself. If $S$ contains objects of $k$ different types,
then there are $k 1$-combinations of $S$.

Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ types, each with an infinite repetitions, then the number of $r$-combinations of $S$
equals
$${}^{r + k - 1}C_r = {}^{r + k - 1}C_{k - 1}.$$

Let $k$ types of objects of $S$ be $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ so that
$$S = \{\infty.a_1, \infty.a_2, \ldots, \infty.a_k\}$$

Any $r$-combination of $S$ is of the form $\{x_1.a_1, x_2.a_2, \ldots, x_k.a_k\}$, where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$ are nonnegative
integers with $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k = r$. The converse is also true. Thus, the number of $r$-combinations of $S$ equals the
number of solutions of the equation $$x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k = r.$$

We will show that the number of solutions of this equation is given by number of permuations of the multiset
$$T = \{r.1, (k - 1).*\}$$
of $r + k - 1$ objects of two different types. Given a permuation of $T,$ the $k - 1 *$'s divide the $r 1$s into $k$ groups. Let
there be $x_1 1$s to the left of the first $*, x_2 1$s between the first and second $*,\ldots,$ and $x_k 1$s to the right of last
$*$. Clearly, $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k = r$. The converse of this is also true. Thus, required combination is given by the
formula $${}^{r + k - 1}C_r = {}^{r + k - 1}C_{k - 1}.$$

\section{Some Important Indentities}
\begin{enumerate}
\item ${}^nP_r = r.{}^{n - 1}P_{r - 1} + {}^{n - 1}P_r$.
\item ${}^nC_r = {}^nC_{n - r}$.
\item ${}^nC_{r - 1} + {}^nC_r = {}^{n + 1}C_r$.

\item If $n$ is even, then the greatest value of ${}^nC_r$ is ${}^nC_m$, where $m = n/2$. If $n$ is odd, then the greatet value is
  ${}^nC_m$, where $m = (n - 1)/2$ or $m = (n + 1)/2$.
\item If $n = 2m + 1$, then ${}^nC_0 < {}^nC_1 < {}^nC_2 < \ldots < {}^nC_m = {}^nC_{m + 1}$. ${}^nC_{m + 1} > {}^nC_{m + 2} >

\item ${}^nC_0 + {}^nC_1 + {}^nC_2 + \ldots + {}^nC_n = 2^n$.

\item ${}^{2n + 1}C_0 + {}^{2n + 1}C_1 + \ldots + {}^{2n + 1}C_n = {}^{2n + 1}C_{n + 1} = {}^{2n + 1}C_{n + 1} + {}^{2n + 1}C_{n +
  2} + \ldots + {}^{2n + 1}C_{2n + 1} = 2^{2n}$.
\item $r.{}^nC_r = n.{}^{n - 1}C_{r - 1}$.

\section{Permutations with Repetitions}
The objective is to find permutation of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ of second type and so on.

Let the different objects be denoted by $a, b, c, \ldots$

Consider the product $$\left(1 + \frac{ax}{1!} + \frac{a^2x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{a^px^p}{p!}\right)\left(1 + \frac{bx}{1!} +
\frac{b^2x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{b^qx^q}{q!}\right)\ldots$$

Required number of permutations $=$ sum of all possible terms of the form $= \frac{r!}{p!q!\ldots}a^pb^q\ldots$ where $p + q + \ldots
= r$

$= r!$. coeff. of $x^r$ in $\left[\left(1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{x^p}{p!}\right)\left(1 + \frac{x}{1!} +
\frac{x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{x^q}{q!}\right)\ldots\right]$

\section{Combinations with Repetitions}
The objective is to find combinations of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects under different cases of repetitions. To begin with we
consider combinations of $r$ objects taken out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ of the second type and so on.

Let the different things be denoted by the letters $a, b, \ldots$

Consider the product $(1 + ax + a^2x^2 + \ldots + a^px^2)(1 + bx + b^2x^2 + \ldots + b^qx^2)\ldots$ All the terms in the product
is of the same degree in the letters $a, b, \ldots$ as in $x$. The coefficient of $x^r$ in the product is the number of ways of
taking $r$ of the letters $a, b, \ldots$ with the restriction that maximum number of $a$'s is $p$, maximum number of $b$'s is $q$ and so
on. Coeff. of $x^r$ will not change if $a = b = \ldots = 1$. Thus required number of combinaitons = Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 + x + x^2 +
\ldots + x^2)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^2)\ldots$

Similarly, number of combinaitons of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ are of second type and $(n -
p - q)$ things are all different $=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $[(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)(1 + x)(1 +
  x)\ldots \text{~to~} (n - p - q)\text{factors~}]$

$=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $[(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)(1 + x)(1 + x)^{n - p - q}]$

Similarly, number of combinations of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ are of second type and so on,
when each thing is taken at least once $=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $[(x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)\ldots]$

$=$ Coeff. of $x^{r - 3}$ in $[(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)$

If $n$ is a negative integer, then $(1 + x)^n = 1 + \frac{n}{1!}x + \frac{n(n - 1)}{2!}x^2 + \ldots\text{~to~}\infty$ [this comes
  from binomial theorem]

So if $n$ is a positive inetger then $(1 + x)^{-n} = 1 + \frac{n}{1!}x + \frac{n(n + 1)}{2!}x^2 + \ldots\text{~to~}\infty$

Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 - x)^{-n} = {}^{n + r - 1}C_r$ which is number of ways in which $r$ identical objects can be distributed
among $n$ persons can get zero of more objects $=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 + x + \ldots + x^r)^n = \left(\frac{1 - x^{r + 1}}{1 -
    x}\right)^n = [(1 - x^{r + 1})(1 - x)^{-n}]$.

$=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 - x)^{-n}$ (leaving powers higher than $x^r$) $= {}^{n + r - 1}C_r$.

\section{Integral Solutions of Equations}
As we have proved earlier, for equation $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_r = n$ is equivalent of distributing $r$ identical objects among
$n$ persons when each person getting zero or more things $= {}^{n + r - 1}C_r$

Similarly, number of non-negative integral solutions of equation $x + 2y + 3z + 4w = n$, equals coeff. of $x^n$ in $[(1 - x)^{-1}(1
  - x)^{-2}(1 - x)^{-3}(1 - x)^{-4}]$.

Similarly, number of positive integral solutions of equation $x + 2y + 3z + 4w = n$, equals coeff. of $x^{n -(1 + 2 + 3 + 4})$ in
$[(1 - x)^{-1}(1 - x)^{-2}(1 - x)^{-3}(1 - x)^{-4}]$.

\section{Geometrical Applications of Combinations}
Some basic geometrical results involving combinations are given below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $n$ non-concurrent and non-parallel straight lines, points of intersection are ${}^nC_2$.
\item The number of straight lines constructed out of $n$ points, when no three points are collinear, are ${}^nC_2$.
\item Given $n$ points, if $m$ are collinear, then number of straight lines possible are ${}^nC_2 - {}^mC_2 + 1$.
\item In a polygon, total number of diagonals out of a $n$ points, when no three points are collinear, are $\frac{n(n - 3)}{2}$.
\item Number of triangles formed from $n$ points, when no three points are collinear, are ${}^nC_3$.
\item Number of triangles formed out of $n$ points in which $m$ are collinear, ${}^nC_3 - {}^mC_3$.
\item Number of triangles constructed out of $n$ points, when none of the side is common with the sides of polygon, are ${}^nC_3 -
  {}^nC_1 - {}^nC_1.{}^{n - 4}C_1$.
\item Number of parallelogram constructed by two system of parallel lines, when first set contains $m$ parallel lines and second
  set contains $n$ parallel lines, are ${}^nC_2\times{}^mC_2$.
\item Number of squares formed by two system of parallel lines in which first set is perpendicular to second set of lines, when
  first set contains $m$ parallel lines and second set contains $n$ parallel lines is $\displaystyle\sum_{r=1}^{m - 1}(m - r)(n -
  r);~m<n$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Number of Divisors and Sum of Divisors}
Let $n = p_1^{n_1}.p_2^{n_2}\ldots p_n^{n_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $n_1, n_2, \ldots,
n_k\in \mathbb{P}$. Obvously, any divisor of $n$ is of the form $d = p_1^{m_1}.p_2^{m_2}\ldots p_k^{m_k}$ where $m_1, m_2,
\ldots\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $0\leq m_i\leq n_i, i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$. Therefore, the total no. of divisors for $n$ will be equal
to the number of ways of selecting at least one from $n_1$ identical prime numbers $p_1, n_2$ primes $p_2$ and so on. The number of
such ways is $$(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)\ldots(n_k + 1)$$. These divisors will also include $1$ and $n$, so obviously, number of divisors
other than $1$ and $n$ is $$(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)\ldots(n_k + 1) - 2$$

The sum of all divisors for $n$ is given by $$\sum_{r_1=0}^{n_1}\sum_{r_2=0}^{n_2}\ldots\sum_{r_k=0}^{n_k}
p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2}\ldots p_k^{r_k}$$

$$=\left(\frac{p_1^{n_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}\right)\left(\frac{p_2^{n_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}\right)\ldots\left(\frac{p_k^{n_k + 1} - 1}{p_k -
  1}\right)$$

\section{Exponent of Prime $p$ in $n!$}
Let $E_p(m)$ denote the exponent of the prime $p$ in the positive integer $m$. We have $$E_p(n!) = E_p[1.2.3.4\ldots(n - 1).n]$$
The last integer amongst $1, 2, 3, \ldots, (n - 1), n$ which is divisible by $p$ is $[n/p]p$, where $[x]$ denotes the greatest
integer $\leq x$. Therefore, $$E_p(n!) = E_p\left(p.2p.3p\ldots \left[\frac{n}{p}p\right]\right)$$ because the remaining integers
from the set $(1, 2, 3, \ldots, (n - 1), n)$ are not divisible by $p$.

$$E_p(n!) = \left[\frac{n}{p}\right] + E_p\left(1.2.3\ldots \left[\frac{n}{p}\right]\right)$$

The last integer amongst $1, 2, \ldots, [n/p]$ which is divisible by $p$ is $$\left[\frac{[n/p]}{p}\right]p =
\left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right]p$$

$$\Rightarrow E_p(n!) = \left[\frac{n}{p}\right] + \left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right] + E_p\left(1.2\ldots\left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right]\right)$$

Proceeding similarly, $$E_p(n!) = \left[\frac{n}{p}\right] + \left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right] + \ldots \left[\frac{n}{p^s}\right]$$
where $p^s\leq n\leq p^{s+1}$

\section{Inclusion-Exclusion Principle}
\textbf{Definition:} The number of objects of the set $S$ that have none of the properties $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_m$ is given by the
alternating expression
$$\displaystyle|\bar{A_1}\cap\bar{A_2}\cap\ldots\cap\bar{A_m}| = |S| - \sum|A_i| + \sum|A_i\cap A_j| -\sum|A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k| +
\ldots + (-1)^m|A_1\cap A_2\cap\ldots A_m|,$$
where the first sum is over all $1$-subsets of $\{i\}$ of $\{1, 2, \ldots,m\},$ the second sum is over all $2$-subsets $\{i, j\}$
of $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$ the third sum is all over $3$-subsets $\{i, j, k\}$ of $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\},$ and so until the $m$th sum
over all $m$-subsets of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2\}$ of which the only one is itself.

The subtraction principle is the simplest instance of inclusion-exclusion principle. As a first generalization of the substraction
principle, let $S$ be a finite set of objects, and let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be two "properties" that each objects in $S$ may or may not
possess.
