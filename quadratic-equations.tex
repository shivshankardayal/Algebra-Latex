\chapter{Quadratic Equations}
An equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a, b, c\in C$, the set of complex numbers, is called a \textit{quadratic
  equation}. The numbers $a, b, c$ are called \textit{coefficients} of the equation. The quantity $b^2 - 4ac$ is called the
\textit{discriminant} of the equation. It is represented by $D$ or $\Delta$.
