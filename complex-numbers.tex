\chapter{Complex Numbers}
By definition a complex number has two parts: a real part and an imaginary part. You already know about real numbers and know about
them. However, imaginary numbers is something different.
\section{Imaginary Numbers}
Imaginary numbers are called so because there cannot be physical representation of these quantities. Like we use real numbers for
counting physical objects we cannot do that with imaginary numbers. In real world, they do not exist. Square root of negative
numbers are called imaginary numbers. For example, $\sqrt{-1}, \sqrt{-2}. \sqrt{-3}, \ldots$ and so on.

We denote $\sqrt{-1}$ with the Greek symbol $\iota$, which stands for \textit{iota}. We also use English letters \textit{i} or
\textit{j} to represent this imaginary number. Clearly, $i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, i^4 = 1$. If you examine carefully, you will find that
following holds true:

$$i^{4m} = 1, i^{4m + 1} = i, i^{4m + 2} = -1 \text{~and~} i^{4m +3} = -1, \forall m\in P$$

\dangersign \textbf{Gotcha:}

Consider the following:

$$1 = \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{-1*-1} = \sqrt{-1}*\sqrt{-1} = i*i = -1$$

However, the above result is wrong. The reason being is that for any two real numbers $a$ and $b, \sqrt{a}*\sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$
holds good if and only if two numbers are either zero or positive. Also, $\sqrt{1}\neq \sqrt{-1*-1}$ because power of $-$ is
$\frac{1}{2}$ which results in $-1$.

\section{Definitions Related to Complex Numbers}
A complex number is written as $a + ib$ or $x + iy$ or $a + jb$ or $x + jb$. Here, $a, b, x, y$ are all real numbers. The complex
numbers itself is denoted by $z$. Therefore, we have $z = x + iy$. Here, $x$ is called the real part and is also denoted by $Re(z)$
and $y$ is called the imaginary part and is also denoted by $Im(z)$.

A complex number is purely real if its imaginary part or $y$ or $Im(z)$ is zero. Similarly, a complex number is purely imaginary if
its real part or $x$ or $Re(z)$ is zero. Clearly, as you can imagine that there can exist only one number which has both the parts
as zero and certainly that is $0$. That is, $0=0+i0$.

The set of all complex number is typically denoted by $C$. Two complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$ are said to be true if there real
parts are equal and imaginary parts are equal. That is if $z_1=x_1+iy_1$ and $z_2=x_2+iy_2$ then $x_1$ must be equal to $x_2$ and
similarly for imaginary part for two complex numbers to be equal.

\section{Simple Arithmetic Operations}
\subsection{Addition}
$(a + ib) + (c + id) = (a + c) + i(b + d)$
\subsection{Subtraction}
$(a + ib) - (c + id) = (a - c) + i(b - d)$
\subsection{Multiplication}
$(a + ib) * (c + id) = ac + ibc + iad + bdi^2 = (ac - bd) +i(bc + ad)$
\subsection{Division}
The complex number in denominator must not have both parts as zero. At least one part must be non-zero.

$$\frac{a + ib}{c + id} = \frac{(a + ib)(c - id)}{(c + id)(c -id)} = \frac{(ac + bd) + i(bc -ad)}{c^2+d^2}$$

\section{Conjugate of a Complex Number}
Let $z = x + iy$ be a complex number then its complex conjugate is a number with imaginary part made negative. It is written as
$\overline{z} = x - iy. \overline{z}$ is the typical representation for conjugate of a complex number $z$.

\subsection{Properties of Conjugates}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $z_1 = z_2 \Leftrightarrow \overline{z_1} = \overline{z_2}$

  Clearly as we know for two complex numbers to be equal, both parts must be equal. So this is very easy to understand that if $x_1
  = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$ then this bidirectional condition is always satisfied.
\item $\overline{\left(\overline{z}\right)} = z$

  $z = x + iy$, hence, $\overline{z} = x - iy$. Hence, $\overline{\left(\overline{z}\right)} = x - (-iy) = x + iy = z$
\item $z + \overline{z} = 2Re(z)$

  $z + \overline{z} = x + iy + x - iy = 2x = 2Re(z)$.
\item $z - \overline{z} = 2iIm(z)$

  $z - \overline{z} = x + iy - (x - iy) = 2iy = 2iIm(z)$
\item $z = \overline{z} \Leftrightarrow z$ is purely real.

  Clearly, $x + iy = x - iy \Rightarrow 2iy = 0 \Rightarrow y = 0$. Therefore, $z$ is purely real. Conversely, if $z$ is purely
  real then $z = x$, and thus $z = \overline{z}$.
\item $z + \overline{z} = 0 \Leftrightarrow z$ is purely imaginary.

  Clearly, $x + iy + x - iy = 0 \Rightarrow 2x = 0$. Therefore, $z$ is purely imaginary. Conversely, if $z$ is purely imaginary
  then $z = iy$, and thus $z + \overline{z} = 0$.
\item $z\overline{z} = [Re(z)]^2 + [Im(z)]^2$

  Clearly, $z\overline{z} = (x + iy)(x - iy) = x^2 + y^2 = [Re(z)]^2 + [Im(z)]^2$
\item $\overline{z_1 + z_2} = \overline{z_1} + \overline{z_2}$

  $\overline{z_1 + z_2} = \overline{(x_1 + iy_1) + (x_2 + iy_2)} = \overline{(x_1 + x_2) + i(y_1 + y_2)} = (x_1 + x_2) - i(y_1 +
  y_2) = (x_1 - iy_1) + (x_2 - iy_2) = \overline{z_1} + \overline{z_2}$
\item $\overline{z_1 - z_2} = \overline{z_1} - \overline{z_2}$

  This can be proven like previous item.
\item $\overline{z_1z_2} = \overline{z_1}\overline{z_2}$

  This can be proven like previous item.
\item $\overline{\left(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right)} = \frac{\overline{z_1}}{\overline{z_2}}$ if $z_2\neq 0$

  It can be proven by multiplying and dividing by conjugate of denominator and then applying division formula given above.
\item If $P(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + \ldots + a_nz^n$, where $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and $z$ are complex numbers, then

  $$\overline{P(z)} = \overline{a_0} + \overline{a_1}(\overline{z}) + \overline{a_2}(\overline{z})^2 +
  \overline{a_n}(\overline{z})^n = \overline{P}(\overline{z})$$

  where

  $$\overline{P}(z) = \overline{a_0} + \overline{a_1}z + \overline{a_2}z^2 + \ldots + \overline{a_n}z^n$$
\item If $R(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}$, where $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ are polynomials in $z$, and$Q(z) \neq 0$, then

  $$\overline{R(z)} = \frac{\overline{P}(\overline{z})}{\overline{Q}(\overline{z})}$$
\item If $$z = \begin{vmatrix}a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\ c_1 & c_2 & c_3\end{vmatrix}, \text{~then~}\overline{z}
  = \begin{vmatrix}\overline{a_1} & \overline{a_2} & \overline{a_3}\\ \overline{b_1} & \overline{b_2} & \overline{b_3}
    \\ \overline{c_1} & \overline{c_2} & \overline{c_3}\end{vmatrix},$$
  where $a_i, b_i, c_i(i = 1,2,3)$ are complex numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Modulus of a Complex Number}
Modulus of a complex number $z$ is denoted by $|z|$ and is equal to the real number $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Note that $|z| \geq
0~\forall z \in C$.
\subsection{Properties of Modulus}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $|z| = 0 \Leftrightarrow z = 0$

  Clearly, this means $x^2 + y^2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0$ and $y = 0 \Rightarrow z = 0$.
\item $|z| = |\overline{z}| = |-z| = |-\overline{z}|$

  Clearly, all result in $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
\item $-|z| \leq Re(z) \leq |z|$.

  Clearly, $-\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\leq x\leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
\item $-|z| \leq Im(z) \leq |z|$.

  Clearly, $-\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\leq y\leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
\item $z\overline{z} = |z|^2$

  Clearly, $(x + iy)(x - iy) = x^2 + y^2 = |z|^2.$
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Following relations are very easy and can be proved by the student. If $z_1$ and $z_2$ are two complex numbers then,

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $|z_1z_2| = |z_1||z_2|$

  $|z_1z_2| = |x_1x_2 - y_1y_2 + i(x_1y_2 + x_2y_1)| = \sqrt{(x_1x_2 - y_1y_2)^2 + (x_1y_2 + x_2y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 + y_1)^2(x_2 +
  y_2)^2} = |z_1||z_2|$
\item $\left|\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right| = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}$ if $z_2\neq = 0$
\item $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + \overline{z_1}z_2 + z_2\overline{z_2} = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + 2Re(z_1\overline{z_2})$.
\item $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 - \overline{z_1}z_2 - z_1\overline{z_2} = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + 2Re(z_1\overline{z_2})$.
\item $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2\left(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2\right)$.
\item If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $z_1$ and $z_2$ are complex numbers, then

  $|az_1 + bz_2|^2 + |bz_1 - az_2|^2 = (a^2 + b^2)\left(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2\right)$.
\item If $z_1, z_2\neq = 0$, then $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 \Leftrightarrow \frac{z_1}{z_2}$ is purely imaginary.
\item If $z_1$ and $z_2$ are complex numbers then $|z_1 + z_2| \leq |z_1| + |z_2|$. This inequality can be generalized to more
  terms as well.
\item $|z_1 - z_2| \leq |z_1| + |z_2|, ||z_1| - |z_2||\leq |z_1| + |z_2|$ and $|z_1 - z_2|\geq ||z_1| - |z_2||$. These are trivial
  to prove.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Geometrical Representation}
A complex number $z$ which we have considered to be equal to $x+iy$ in our previous representations can be represented by a point
$P$ whose Cartesian coordinates are $(x,y)$ referred to rectangular axes $Ox$ and $Oy$ where $O$ is origin i.e. $(0, 0)$ and are
called \textit{real} and \textit{imaginary} axes respectively. The $xy$ two-dimensional plane is also called \textit{Argand plane,
complex plane} or \textit{Gaussian plane}. The point $P$ is also called the image of the complex number and $z$ is also called
the \textit{affix} or \textit{complex coordinate} of point $P$.

Now as you can easily figure out that all real numbers will lie on real axis and all imaginary numbers will lie on imaginary axis
as their counterparts will be zero.

The modulus is given by the length of segment $OP$ which is equal to $OP=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=|z|$. This, $|z|$ si the length of the
$OP$. Given below is the graphical representation of the complex number.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[->] (-.5,0) -- (3,0);
      \draw[->] (0,-.5) -- (0,3);
      \draw (0, 3.5) node {$Y$};
      \draw (3.5, 0) node {$X$};
      \draw (2.5,0) -- (2.5,2.5);
      \draw (0,0) -- (2.5, 2.5);
      \draw (.5,0) arc(0:45:.5);
      \draw (.7,.3) node{$\theta$};
      \draw (1.5, 0.2) node {$x$};
      \draw (2.7, 1.5) node {$y$};
      \draw (3.4, 1.1) node {$OP=|z|$};
      \draw (3.5, 0.7) node {$arg(z)=\theta$};
      \draw (2.5, 2.7) node{$P=x+iy$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Complex number in argand plane or complex plane}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In the diagram, $\theta$ is known as the \textit{argument} of $z$. This is nothing but angle made with positive direction
(i.e. counter-clockwise) of real axis. Now, this argument is not unique. If $\theta$ is an argument of a complex number $z$ then,
$2n\pi + theta$, where $n\in I$, where I is the set of integers. The value of argument for which $-\pi<\theta\leq \pi$ is called
the \textit{principal value} of \textit{argument} or \textit{principal argument}.

\subsection{Different Arguments of a Complex Number}
In the diagram, the argument is given as $\arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$, this value is for when $z$ in first
quadrant. When $z$ will lie in second, third and fourth quadrants the arguments will be
$$\arg(z) = \pi - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{|z|}\right), arg(z)= -\pi + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{|y|}{|z|}\right)\text{~and~} arg(z) =
-\tan^P{-1}\left(\frac{|y|}{x}\right)$$
respecticely.

\subsection{Polar Form of a Complex Number}
If $z$ is a non-zero complex number, then we can write $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$, where $r = |z|$ and $\theta = arg(z)$.

In this case, $z$ is also given by $z = r[\cos(2n\pi  \theta) + i\sin(2n\pi + \theta)]$, where $n\in I$.

\subsubsection{Euler's Formula}
The complex number $\cos\theta + i\sin\theta$ is denoted by $e^{i\theta}$ or $c$ is $\theta$, where $c$ is the complex number.

\subsection{Important Results Involving Arguments}
If $z, z_1$ and $z_2$ are complex numbers, then

\begin{enumerate}
\item $arg(\overline{(z)}) = -arg(z)$. This can be easily proven as if $z = x + iy$, then $\overline{z} = x - iy$ i.e. sign of
  argument will get a -ve sign as $y$ gets one.
\item $arg(z_1z_2) = arg(z_1)  + arg(z_2) + 2n\pi$, where
  $$n = \begin{cases}
   0 \text{~if~} & -\pi<arg(z_1)+arg(z_2)\leq-\pi\\
   1 \text{~if~} & -2\pi<arg(z_1)+arg(z_2)\leq-\pi\\
   -1 \text{~if~} & -\pi<arg(z_1)+arg(z_2)\leq2\pi\end{cases}$$
 \item Similarly, $arg(z_1\overline{z_2}) = arg(z_1) - arg(z_2)$.
 \item $|z_1 + z_2| = |z_2 - z_2| \Leftrightarrow arg(z_1) - arg(z_2) = \pi/2$.
 \item $|z_1 + z_2| = |z_1| + |z_2| \Leftrightarrow arg(z_1) = arg(z_2)$.
 \item $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 + 2r_1r_2\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)$.
 \item $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = r_1^2 +r_2^2 + 2r_1r_2\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Vector Representation}
Complex numbers can also be represented as vectors. Length of the vector is nothing but modulus of complex number and argument is
the angle which the vector makes with read axis. It is denoted as $\overrightarrow{OP}$, where $OP$ represents the vector of the
complex number $z$.

\section{Algebraic Operation's Representation}
Let $z_1 = x_1 + iy_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + iy_2$ be two complex numbers, which are represented by two point $P_1$ and $P_2$ in the
following diagrams.

\subsection{Addition}
Now, as we know that $z_1 + z_2 = (x_1 + x_2) + i(y_1 + y_2)$. Let us see how it looks using geometrically:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[->, >=stealth] (-.5,0) -- (5.5,0);
      \draw[->, >=stealth] (0,-.5) -- (0,5.5);
      \draw (5.7, 0) node {$X$};
      \draw (0,5.7) node {$Y$};
      \draw (0,0) -- (4,1);
      \draw (0,0) -- (1,4);
      \draw (1,4) -- (5,5);
      \draw (4,1) -- (5,5);
      \draw[dashed] (4,1) -- (4,0);
      \draw[dashed] (1,4) -- (1,0);
      \draw[dashed] (5,5) -- (5,0);
      \draw[dashed] (4,1) -- (5,1);
      \draw (-.5,-.5) node {$O$};
      \draw (1,-.5) node {$L$};
      \draw (4,-.5) node {$M$};
      \draw (5,-.5) node {$N$};
      \draw (5.2,1) node {$K$};
      \draw (3, 1.2) node {$P1(x_1+iy_1)$};
      \draw (1.3, 4.3) node {$P2(x_2+iy_2)$};
      \draw (5, 5.2) node {$P(x+iy)$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Complex numbers addition}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
Clearly, $z = z_1 + z_2 = x_1 + x_2 + i(y_1 + y_2)$. Let $P_1M, P_2L$ and $PN$ be parallel to the $y$-axis; $P_1K$ be parallet to
the $x$-axis. This implied that triangle $OP_2L$ and $PP_1K$ are congruent.

We have $P_1K = OL = x_1$ and $P_2L = PK = y_1$

Thus, $ON = OM + MN = OL + P_1K = x_1 + x_2$ and $PN = PK + KN = P_2L + P_1M = y_2 + y_1$

So we can say that coordinates of $P$ are $(x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)$ which represents the complex number $z.$

We also see that this obeys vector addition i.e. $OP_1 + OP_2 = OP_1 + P_1P = OP$

\subsection{Subtraction}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{complex-numbers-subtraction}
    \caption{Complex numbers subtraction}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
We first represent $-z_2$ by $P_2'$ so that  $P_2P_2'$ is bisected at $O.$ Complete the parallelogram $OP_1PP_2'.$ Then it can be
easily seen that $P$  representd the difference $z_1 - z_2.$

As $OP_1PP_2'$ is a parallelogram so $P_1P = OP_2'.$ Using vetor notation, we have, $z_1 - z_2 = OP_1 - OP_2 = OP_1 + OP_2' = OP_1 + P_1P = P_2P1$

It follows that the complex number $z_1 - z_2$ is represented by the vector $P_1P_2,$ where points $P_1$ and $P_2$ represent the
complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$ respectively.

It should be noted that $arg(z_1 - z_2)$ is the angle through which $OX$ must be rotated in the anticlockwise direction to make it
parallel with $P_1P_2.$

\subsection{Multiplication}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{complex-numbers-multiplication}
    \caption{Complex numbers multiplication}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
For multiplication it is convenient to use Euler's formula of complex numbers.

Let $z_1 = r_1e^{i\theta_1}$ and $z_2 = r_2e^{i\theta_2},$ then clealry, $z_1z_2 = r_1r_2e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}$
